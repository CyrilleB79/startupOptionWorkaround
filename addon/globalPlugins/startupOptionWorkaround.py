"""Script to work around the following issue 
With Windows 10 1903 update, NVDA may start after logon even when this is disabled in General settings panel (cf. #9528 [https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/9528]).
This script does not fix the issue. However, as a work-around, it unloads NVDA just after startup in the case it should not have started up at all.
Of course, when [#9528][1] is fixed in NVDA (or in Windows), this script is useless and should be removed.
